# Snippet from Machine learning mastery with python book
''' 
Get good at plotting. Condent to the point that you can copy-and-paste a recipe to plot data
at the drop of a hat. It is an invaluable skill. I think you will be best served looking at lots
of Matplotlib examples for dierent plot types and preparing recipes for yourself to use later.
Making pretty plots is a dierent topic entirely and for that I would recommend studying the
API carefully. I see plots as disposable tools for learning more about a problem.
